From the start of the trimester, our master plan has been to create a website that CSP students can use to study computer science and prepare themselves for the AP CSP exam. All of our meaningful contributions have been items that contribute to this theme, such as topic pages that teach students about computer science, or a calendar that allows users to view events set by admins, such as test days or the final AP exam date. We have also been able to incorporate our Sponsor's requirements, which were to make a website that would integrate all the previously made TPT and TT notes into a seamless experience, which more specifically meant having very similar CSS between our meain website and GitHub pages, where we put all of this information. Overall, our team has put a lot of effort into this porject, and has almost always been on task in class.

## Project Description: 
This project is a continuations of "Backpack Pro", a project one of our team members worked on during Trimester 2. The website focuses on providing students with helpful and educational resources to further their education. This includes several classes, including CSP. 

## Project Plans: 
Our plan is to keep adding on to the tutoring features and services present in "Backpack Pro". Alongside this we also plan on incorporating some ideas or features requested by our Project Owner, such as platform-wide SCSS for platforms such as GitHub wikis and the Nighthawk Coder Society website. This would allow future students to access and read TPT and TT information without having to jump across multiple platforms, which would make the learning experience easier and more seamless We are also thinking about adding or creating a study calendar / organizer for CSP students, which would allow to plan our their week or studying so that they don't procrastinate or forget to do anything.
