1. UAVs/Drones are used in search & rescue, aerial photography, and for hobbies.  However, there are many unintended usages. Also, there are many military usages.  What do people think about drones?
1. Dopamine plays a role in how we feel pleasure.  Video games and Social media are shown to impact people chemically.  However, statistically some people's computer time may be greater than their sleep time.   There are positives on games and social media.  Name some?  Here is something to think about and is related to the CB topic...
    * At age 17, Anthony Rosner of London, England, was a hero in the World of Warcraft online gaming community. He built empires, led raids, and submerged himself in a fantasy world that seemingly fulfilled his every need. Meanwhile, his real life was virtually nonexistent. He neglected his schoolwork, relationships, health, even his hygiene.  "I never saw my real friends. I gained weight, became lazy, and spent nearly all of my time slumped over my computer," says Rosner, who played up to 18 hours a day, every day, for nearly two years.  "When you become one of the top players in a game like World of Warcraft, tens of thousands of players are essentially under you, so you become like a virtual god"
    * For Rosner, gaming was detrimental. His grades suffered, he missed assignments, and he almost failed to complete his first year of college. After turning away from the game, Rosner found other sources of pleasure. He joined a gym, started DJing at his university, and became much more active socially. "I couldn't believe what I had been missing," he says.  Ironically, World of Warcraft led Rosner to achieve his dream of making films. His documentary, IRL — In Real Life, chronicles his adventures and how he learned to break free from gaming. More than 1 million people worldwide have viewed his film, which can be seen on YouTube. It has been featured at film festivals, on TV, and in newspapers and magazines.

1. Automated telephone trees were designed to save employers money, but also reduce hold time for customers.  Innovations in phone trees, voice recognition, or keypads often enables customers to find answers quickly.  What are innovation you would like to see in phone tree?  Will this phone tree transfer you to relevant department during office hours?  Will it always enable you the opportunity for human response?

### GitHub pages action
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
1. Talk about dopamine issues above.  Real?  Parent conspiracy?  Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

## Digital Divide
### Deals with "To Have and Have Not" in relation to Computers, Internet, or Technology in general.
* Poorer or rural areas in America and other countries may have less or little access to Technology
* Some countries may have different or restricted access, for instance China and USA may have divide in service allowed in their countries.

### Contributing factors to divide are socioeconomic (money), geographic (location), demographic (education, nationality, religion, and ethnicity)
* Individual may have less access to latest updates, thus may be working on older generations of computers
* Religious groups like the Amish choose not to use technology
* San Diego county has regional distinction in many categories between Northern and Southern population, usually indicated by Interstate 8.
* Sunnyvale CA has been know as technology hub of influence for the entirety of the United States.


### At the start of pandemic 90,000 school children in New Jersey did not have access to computers capable of distance learning.

### In education equity requires school to provide materials like Computers or Chrome books.  Here is some counter thinking.
* In our environment, Del Norte CS preference is that you have your own computer so that you can work away from school.
* In our classroom, internet blockers at router and lack of admin password can make school computer less productive than personally owned computer.
* Education is often concerned about cyberbullying, sexting, or student privacy.  What do you think of investments being made in protection versus investments being made in technology education?  Are digital fears expanding digital divide?

### GitHub pages action -- Digital Empowerment
* How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
* How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered?  Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
* Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment?  Are there such barriers at Del Norte?  Elsewhere?

## Big Idea 5.3 - [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

## Computer Bias
Earlier we talked about beneficial and harmful effects of computing.  Such conversation often lead to conversations on computer bias, particularly when bias creates a harmful effect.

As programmers, you now have the possibility of creating algorithms.  It has been said, "Humans are error-prone and biased".  So, does that mean algorithms and the computers they run on are better?

<img src="https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csp/blob/master/static/assets/computerbias.webp" height="400">


### Intentional or Purposeful bias
* Facebook vs TikTok, is there purposeful exclusion?  Is it harmful?  Should it be corrected?  Is it good business?
* Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri original had flaws in detecting accents or young voices, was this purposeful?  Is it harmful?  Should it be corrected?  Is it good business?
* Netflix, do their algorithm purposely bias certain content to certain watchers?  Is it harmful?  Is it good business?

### GitHub Pages Actions.  Break out into Study Groups of 2 or 3
* Watch the video... [HP computers are racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM)
* Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you.  Here are some ideas...
    * Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
    * If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
    * How do you think this happened?
    * Is this harmful?  Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
    * Should it be corrected?
    * What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?

## Crowdsourcing
The more you crowdsource, the more you reach beyond your own community, the more you will reduce Computer Bias.  Crowdsourcing provides the ability to obtain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing.

<img src="https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csp/blob/master/static/assets/crowdsourcing.jpeg" height="400">


### Evidence of Crowdsourcing
* Wikipedia has a ton of information from crowdsourcing, see [Wikipedia definition on crowdsourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing).  It can have inaccuracies, but when it does it often is corrected through a self-policing community.  Reviews and many authors have made this, according to many, better than "official" information.
* Crypto currency and associated block chain.  All exchanges of money are validated at least 3-times by independent miners.  If there is a flaw in the independent calculations the process is checked and performed again.  Innovation of crypto crowdsourcing has impact on how governments think about currency.   Additionally, block chain algorithms are being considered for many other crowdsourcing most private data (ie medical records).
* COVID data, it is easy to recognize areas that are contributing and not contributing.   This data has impacted all our lives and decision we make on attending public events, flying on planes, or wearing masks.  The community of data and analysts will spawn many new ways of thinking about data that impacts lives.  

### Obtaining Data via Crowdsourcing
* We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API's, namely RapidAPI.  This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data.
* Additionally, we have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub.  Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students.  Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history.  The Teacher presenting these videos recommends Kaggle for code and science exploration.  Then of course, once we have an idea what to "Learn", the avenue of crowdsource youtube or google searched articles make the word our Teacher.  

### GitHub pages actions
* CompSci has 150 principles students.  Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?  
* What about Del Norte crowdsourcing?  Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?

## Legal and Ethical Concerns
Free Software Licensing is the primary topic of this section.  

### Cost of Free
In my most recent years in industry, there were many Lawyers making a profession on Patents and how they can be impacted on General Public Licensing (GPL).  

Qualcomm makes its **money on patents**, if you use GPL software you could be voiding your rights to charge for software and patents.  **Open Source** by nature, specifically GPL, says any derivative work is free and code should be shared.   Qualcomm wants all derivative work to **require a royalty payment** payment, also anyone who uses the idea/patent pays royalty.

<img src="https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csp/blob/master/static/assets/blackduck.png" height="400">

From synopsis.com, "Black Duck® software composition analysis (SCA) helps teams manage the security, quality, and license compliance risks that come from the use of open source and third-party code in applications and containers."  Qualcomm has had 20 technical jobs and 3 lawyers analyzing all the code produced, analyzing code for Open Source inclusion, and analyzing impact of such licenses to its ability to charge royalties for the use of their Patents.  

This may sound like a simple problem, but think about the **Students of Today**, often they are given an assignment and instead of developing their own algorithm they opt to copy something off the internet.   Well, don't think the **Workers of Today** are entirely different.  In summary, it is important to **know the type of software license you are copying**, it could impact billions of dollars in business.

### [License Communities](https://choosealicense.com/community/), License Types [Guide](https://choosealicense.com/)
* Adding and selecting a license [GitHub instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository).  An author, a licensor, needs to determine a license.  This may result in asking...
1. Do I want to waive default copyright in reuse?
2. Do I want to allow derivative works or not?
3. Do I want to require all derivative code to be shared?

#### Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal
The Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication waives copyright interest in a work you've created and dedicates it to the world-wide public domain.

#### Open Source [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
This license in friendly to someone like Qualcomm!  This allows using code freely and making and distributing **closed source versions**.

#### Open Source GPL License
The GNU GPLv3 also lets people do almost anything they want with your project, **except** distributing closed source versions.

For a company like Qualcomm, they are required to institute many practices to deliver their code in parts.  Isolating their patent and secret code, far away from the GPL Creative Commons code.  In fact, a company that is protecting their patents may need to division engineers, split distribution code, etc.   Even though, the customer of the derivative work is required to put the code back together again to make it work.


### Legal and Ethically
We need to comply with the terms of licenses.  We need to cite sources.  (I am particularly bad with internet pictures. However, in the picture of the Black Duck above I am actually advertising the Company).

As consumers, we have become aware that Music and Movie companies own content.  These companies build DRM (Digital Rights Management) software to protect, play, and/or distribute content.  Most of us buy subscriptions to services.  However, some figure out ways to bypass systems and allow download.  Often we will see these sites disappear, as they are illegal.

In software, it can be more complicated to understand all the Creative Commons licenses and its impact to our own ideas and businesses.   Mostly, if we use things in class, there is no problem with Open Source as it is considered educational use.   Creative Commons software has enabled amazing innovation as we are able to do so much for free, as we have done in this class.  However, Individuals and Companies are required to figure out techniques and business models in order to use Open Source software according to terms of license.  

Long ago, I remember being amazed that Red Hat was not selling its Linux distribution, they were giving away the software.  They had to as the terms of the license were GPL.   However, as an early pioneers in Linux distributions, they established a business model around buying their support agreement.  They rose in fortune, became a public company, and had an amazing Initial Public Offering (IPO).  Many, many vendors have followed the Red Hat model in building free distributions and establish unique business models.  Qualcomm figured out how to mix Patent and GPL businesses and have flourished since abandoning all proprietary, to include Android in its very complicated business model.

Creative Commons, Open Source are free terminologies!  However, businesses will not last without income.  And today, businesses won't last without engineers pulling Open Source software.

## GitHub pages actions:
1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type.  Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
1. Make a license for your personal and Team project.  Document license you picked and why.

## Big Idea 5.6 - [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

## Safe Computing

### Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
As we create Web Site and post information we are adding to Searchable PII.  However, there is a dichotomy as a site **like LinkedIn is a place where we want to be know for our accomplishments.  But beware, the person that looks at your LinkedIn will, **most likely**, look at things like Instagram or Facebook.  

### PII considerations

* Things that will be known by everyone:  Name, Email (suggest a junk email), Picture, High School attended, College Attended, Properties you own, State-City of residence, all State-City of previous residence, Credit Report 
* Gray are items, more cautious: Birthdate, Place of Birth, Street Address, Phone Number, Maiden names of Mother and Grandmother, Drivers License Number
* Things that you should strive to keep absolutely secret: Credentials for Access, Two-Factor Authentication on Financial accounts, Social Security Number, Tax records

### Beware, Establish practices for your own Safety
* Multi-factor authentication often requires you to enter a code that has been texted or emailed to you.   Other types of authentication are biometrics (finger print or facial recognition).
* Malware is often sent in attachments to things in email.  Often they request you to click on an attachment and it starts the process of adding a virus to your computer.
* Phishing is where unknown sources try to entice you into a response, like click here and receive $500.  Often such systems impersonate someone like Amazon asking for login information.

### Factors to Increase Security of System (**recommend** Watch 5.6 Video 2)
* Most of my financials or critical system use **Multi Factor authentication**
* Biometrics is something that is used secure systems, fingerprints or facial recognition
* Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic information.
* Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, is a process that uses a pair of related keys -- one public key and one private key -- to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it from unauthorized access or use.
* SSL Uses both Asymmetric and Symmetric Encryption

### Nefarious Uses of Internet
* Virus or Malware are opposite of Increasing Security
* Phishing is a way to get a Virus on your machine, or a way to get you to input PII

### GitHub Pages actions:
1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.   
1. What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
1. Describe good and bad passwords?  What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
1. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.  
1. Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
1. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way.  Describe some other phishing techniques.
