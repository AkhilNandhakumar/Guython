## Project Description: 
This project is a continuations of "Backpack Pro", a project one of our team members worked on during Trimester 2. The website focuses on providing students with helpful and educational resources to further their education. This includes several classes, including CSP. 

## Project Plans: 
Our plan is to keep adding on to the tutoring features and services present in "Backpack Pro". Alongside this we also plan on incorporating some ideas or features requested by our Project Owner, such as platform-wide SCSS for platforms such as GitHub wikis and the Nighthawk Coder Society website. This would allow future students to access and read TPT and TT information without having to jump across multiple platforms, which would make the learning experience easier and more seamless We are also thinking about adding or creating a study calendar / organizer for CSP students, which would allow to plan our their week or studying so that they don't procrastinate or forget to do anything.
