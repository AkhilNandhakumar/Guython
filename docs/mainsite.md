<p style="text-align: center">Nighthawk Tutoring is a website meant to aid CSP students in studying for the AP Exam and learning valuable CS skills. Our main features include a GitHub pages website with well organized Tech Talk and Test Prep Tuesday lectures from trimester 3, a planning calendar for students to organize their workload throughout the week, and mini quizzes where students can test their knowledge. Our website uses a GPL license which enables users to access our content for free, but stops other programmers from reusing our project for profit.</p>
