    <p>How it affects the weather:</p>
</div>

<div class="t1" style="text-align: right; margin-left: 750px; margin-right: 20px; max-width: 100%">
    <p>The sun keeps the Earth warm and lit up.  Without the sun, the surface of the Earth would turn into an icy wasteland. As the Earth rotates around the Sun, the temperature on Earth changes in the form of changing seasons. During the summer, the sun is closer to Earth, where it gets warmer. On the other hand, during the winter, the sun is further away from the Earth, which causes temperatures to drop.</p>
