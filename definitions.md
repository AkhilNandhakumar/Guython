### Binary / Hexadecimal
[Binary Lab](https://5hackers.tk/lab4)
### Bit
[Binary Math with Conversions](5hackers.tk/hackathontt3)

a single unit of information in a computer (Binary Digit)
### Nibble / Byte
A Nibble is 4 bits, while a Byte is 8 bits
### Lossless/Lossy Compression
Lossless Compression: data compression algorithm that allows original data to be perfectly reconstructed from compressed data.
Lossy Compression: data compression algorithm where some amount of data is lost, attempts to eliminate redundant information.
### Metadata
[RGB Lab](5hackers.tk/lab3)
### Computer Network
Computers connected together to share information and resources
### Parallel/Distributed computing
Parallel Computing: mutliple processors executing tasks at the same time to obtain results faster.
Distributed computing: systems in different locations communicate to complete a task.
### Protocol
set of rules controlling the exchange of data between devices.
### TCP/IP
TCP: Transmission Control Protocol (puts IP packets in sequence and checks for errors in transmission)
IP: Internet Protocol (main delivery system for information on the internet)
### HTTP
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (used to connect to Web servers on the Internet or local networks)
### GET / POST
[Greet Function](5hackers.tk/lab1)
### MVC
Model View Controller: software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements
### CRUD
[CRUD Operations](5hackers.tk/crud)
### FETCH
fetching data from one source to another (disk to memory buffer, memory to CPU)
### Async Operations
tasks performed without dependency on each other
### REST
Representational State Transfer (provides standards between computer systems on the web, easier to communicate)
### API/Library
[API Collection](5hackers.tk/api_collection)
### OOP
Object Oriented Programming (organizes software design around data rather than functions)
### Class
program/code template for creating objects
### Attribute
changeable property / characterisitic of a part of a program that can be changed to different values
### Method
procedure associated with a message and an object
### Object
Objects can be anything: functions, methods, variables, data structures, etc.
### Procedures/Functions
[Mini Quizzes](5hackers.tk/math)
### Data/procedural Abstraction
Data: Information translated into a form that is more efficient for processing or moving
Procedural Abstraction: writing code sections (procedures) that have variable parameters, allowing them to be used in multiple situations
### Sort
[Search Bar](5hackers.tk/crud/search)
### Search-Linear/Binary
Linear Search: sequentially checking elements in a list, rarely used because of slowness
Binary Search: searches an array by dividing sections in half until object is found, fast and commonly used
### Blueprints
an alternate method of creating app routes
