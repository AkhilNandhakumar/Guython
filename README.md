## Project Description: 

## Project Plans: 
Our plan is to keep adding on to the tutoring features and services present in "Backpack Pro". Alongside this we also plan on incorporating some ideas or features requested by our Project Owner, such as platform-wide SCSS for platforms such as GitHub wikis and the Nighthawk Coder Society website.
