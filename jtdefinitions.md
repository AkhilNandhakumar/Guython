### Binary / Hexadecimal
[Binary Lab](https://5hackers.tk/lab4)

Binary: base 2 number system (0 and 1), used by computers to store information

Hexadecimal: base 16 number system, uses 0-9 and A-F
### Bit
[Binary Math with Conversions](https://5hackers.tk/hackathontt3)

a single unit of information in a computer (Binary Digit)
### Nibble / Byte
A Nibble is 4 bits, while a Byte is 8 bits
### Lossless/Lossy Compression
Lossless Compression: data compression algorithm that allows original data to be perfectly reconstructed from compressed data.

Lossy Compression: data compression algorithm where some amount of data is lost, attempts to eliminate redundant information.
### Metadata
[RGB Lab](https://5hackers.tk/lab3)

data that describes other data
### Computer Network
Computers connected together to share information and resources
### Parallel/Distributed computing
Parallel Computing: mutliple processors executing tasks at the same time to obtain results faster.
Distributed computing: systems in different locations communicate to complete a task.
### Protocol
set of rules controlling the exchange of data between devices.
### TCP/IP
TCP: Transmission Control Protocol (puts IP packets in sequence and checks for errors in transmission)

IP: Internet Protocol (main delivery system for information on the internet)
### HTTP
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (used to connect to Web servers on the Internet or local networks)
### GET / POST
[Greet Function](https://5hackers.tk/lab1)

GET: request method that sends all form data to the server

POST: request method used for sensitive information
### MVC
Model-View-Controller: software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements
### CRUD
[CRUD Operations](https://5hackers.tk/crud)

Create, Read, Update, Delete (important functions for a storage application) 
### FETCH
fetching data from one source to another (disk to memory buffer, memory to CPU)
### Async Operations
[Async CRUD Operations](https://5hackers.tk/crud_api)

tasks performed without dependency on each other
### REST
Representational State Transfer (provides standards between computer systems on the web, easier to communicate)
### API/Library
[API Collection](https://5hackers.tk/api_collection)

Applications Program Interface (A library of classes for use in other programs. Provides standard interfaces that hide the details of implementation)
### OOP
Object Oriented Programming (organizes software design around objects interacting with each other)
### Class
program/code template for creating objects
### Attribute
changeable property / characteristic of a part of a program that can be changed to different values
### Method
functions or procedures inside a class that can be accessed through objects.
### Object
Objects can be anything: functions, methods, variables, data structures, etc.
### Procedures/Functions
[Mini Quizzes](https://5hackers.tk/math)

Procedure: block of code that accomplishes a certain task, executes commands

Function: similar to a procedure, but also returns a result
### Data/procedural Abstraction
Data: Information translated into a form that is more efficient for processing or moving

Procedural Abstraction: writing code sections (procedures) that have variable parameters, allowing them to be used in multiple situations
### Sort
[Search Bar](https://5hackers.tk/crud/search)

Putting elements in a list in a specific order
### Search-Linear/Binary
Linear Search: sequentially checking elements in a list, rarely used because of slowness

Binary Search: searches an array by dividing sections in half until object is found, fast and commonly used
### Blueprints
an alternate method of creating app routes
